# config-files

This repo is just to allow me to have all my configuration files (right now just in Linux) in one place where I can access them.

NOTE: Remember to use these programs:
- xpanes (for multiple connections)
- tmuxinator (for easy tmux script writing)
- chrony or ntpd (for syncing time on different machines)
- supervisord with cesi (for nice web gui for processes)
